Seed buffer v1 completed a 70-match, seven-opponent development suite with a 100.0% macro match score, zero errors, and zero final crop leftovers.

Wheat v1 uses a concurrent wheat-plant cap of eight. It completed an 80-match, eight-opponent development suite with a 100.0% macro match score and zero errors. Its 20-seed validation against Hand v2 and Seed buffer v1 produced a 96.2% macro match score with zero errors. Wheat and melon had no final leftovers; small carrot leftovers remain an endgame optimization opportunity.
